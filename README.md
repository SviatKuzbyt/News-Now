# News-Now
Application for viewing news from around the world. You can browse the latest news of your region or search for them by keywords and also save them for later.

## Features
- The program consists of 4 tabs:
  - **Overview** - displays the latest news of the selected region.
  - **Search** - consists of a text field where you enter a query, keywords and also from the list of news on your request
  - **Saved** - it contains all the saved news that you can then view
  - **Settings** - here you can select the region and search options

- There is a dark theme and supporting 10 languages
- **Structure**
  - The program consists of MainActivity where ToolBar, BottomNavigationView and Fragment are placed where tabs are placed
  - I used the recommended architecture in the design, so all fragments work through ViewModel
